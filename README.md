# Introduction
Hi, I have created a simulation/clone of the New York Times' game: "Connections"

# How To Play
You can play by running in tester.Main as the main class. The goal is to correctly connect four groups of four words that share a common theme. 
You win if you correctly guess all four groups in fewer than four tries. If you do win, you will be greeted with a custom message correlating with how 
many tries it took. If you lose, it will display a loss message.

Keybinds:
[Left-Click] -> Select Words,
[D] -> Deselect Selected Words,
[S] -> Shuffle Board,
[Esc] -> Clear Board,
[Enter] -> Submit Group

# How to Run
You can run the game by having the main class be tester.Main and the program arguments be set to ExamplesConnections
